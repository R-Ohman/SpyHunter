# SpyHunter

Desktop application of an Atari game called Spy Hunter. The object of the game is to drive down roads and destroy other (enemy) vehicles, using the weapons that are
available for the player. The project is based on the Atari 2600 version of the game.

The 2D game developed using the SDL 2.0 library without using the Standard Template Library.
The game has enemy and allied vehicles. For destroying enemy ones, the player gets points and for destroying allies, the player gets a penalty. The player can collide cars and shoot at them. Enemy vehicles try to harm the player. During the game, the player can pick up bonuses that improve shooting or speed up the player. The game ends at the end of the lives that are awarded during the game. 

The game has an interface that allows you to start the game, view saved results from previous games (sorted by time or points), pause the game, save and load the game status from a file on your computer.
